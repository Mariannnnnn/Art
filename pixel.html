         Winter animated pack with sprite 3 sheet loops for 
         better and real-life look in the game Other technology what I
         used is parallax sheets for interactive sky.
         It was a lot of work but i created dirty,shadow sheets 
         for better detailed look.

         This graphic pack was inspired by Harry Potter and Scottish
         movies. This pack was a challenge because the main part of the graphic     
         was rain. I've done interactive rain, water sheets and the same for 
         parallax sky, characters, face sheet. Includes all tech from the winter pack.

         Alien Planet graphic set was the most challenging because the infinity animated

         and new bio life as threes,bushes,characters,face sheets and much more.
